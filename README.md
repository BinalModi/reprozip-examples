ReproZip Examples
=================

This repository holds some examples and demos that we built to showcase and evaluate the [ReproZip software packing tool](https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/reprozip).

You'll find more info about each particular example in its associated README.

Examples
========

* [digits_sklearn](digits_sklearn): A supervised learning and classification experiment written in Python, using scikit-learn. It is split in 4 different scripts, to make the generated VisTrails workflow interesting.
* [bash-count](bash-count): A simple bash script that makes for an interesting graph, since each command that is called is a separate process.
