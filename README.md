ReproZip Examples
=================

This repository holds some examples and demos from different domains that showcase [the ReproZip software packing tool](https://vida-nyu.github.io/reprozip/).

You'll find more info about each particular example in its associated README.

Examples
--------

* [bash-count](bash-count): A simple bash script that makes for an interesting graph, since each command is a separate process.
* [digits-sklearn](digits-sklearn): A supervised learning and classification experiment written in Python, using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/).
* [digits-sklearn-opencv](digits-sklearn-opencv): A similar experiment to [digits-sklearn](digits-sklearn), but using [the OpenCV library](http://opencv.org/) to extract the digits from a photograph before predicting their values.
* [ising-model](ising-model): A typical simulation in statistical physics, consisting of large scale Monte Carlo simulations followed by an involved statistical analysis of the results.

Instructions for reproducing the examples use the [vagrant unpacker](http://reprozip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/unpacking.html#the-vagrant-unpacker-building-a-virtual-machine). However, any of the [available unpackers](http://reprozip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/unpacking.html#unpackers) can be used.
