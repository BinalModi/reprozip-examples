ReproZip Examples
=================

This repository holds some examples and use cases from different domains that showcase [the ReproZip software packing tool](https://vida-nyu.github.io/reprozip/).

You'll find more information about each particular example in its associated README.

Examples
--------

*Creating a provenance graph*

* [bash-count](bash-count): A simple bash script that counts the number of pages of an input file.

*Reproducing published results*

* [bechdel-test](bechdel-test): A data analysis experiment that tries to reproduce the claims of an [article](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/) from FiveThirtyEight.
* [data-polygamy](data-polygamy): A paper published at SIGMOD 2016 whose plots were made reproducible using ReproZip.
* [ising-model](ising-model): A typical simulation in statistical physics, consisting of large scale Monte Carlo simulations followed by an involved statistical analysis of the results.
* [irish-schools](irish-schools): An example from digital humanities, where publication ready graphs and materials are generated from tabular data using R.
* [mongodb-vls](mongodb-vls): A paper published at ICDE 2016 whose plots were made reproducible using ReproZip. 

*Extending the original experiment in VisTrails*

* [digits-sklearn](digits-sklearn): A supervised learning and classification experiment written in Python, using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/).

*Packing interactive and GUI applications*

* [bus-vis](bus-vis): A Java application for visualizing the Konstanz bus transportation system.

*Reproducing the experiment with a different input*

* [digits-sklearn-opencv](digits-sklearn-opencv): A similar experiment to [digits-sklearn](digits-sklearn), but using [the OpenCV library](http://opencv.org/) to extract the digits from a photograph before predicting their values.

*Archiving and porting web applications*

* [django-blog](django-blog): A simple website built with Django that displays a list of blog posts and allows the admin to edit or post. Despite its simplicity, it represents a realistic small web application using a database (SQLite3).
* [stacked-up](stacked-up): A website called [Stacked Up](http://stackedup.org/), also built with Django, to explore the textbook inventory of Philadelphia public schools. All the data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.

Instructions for reproducing the examples use the [vagrant](http://reprozip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/unpacking.html#the-vagrant-unpacker-building-a-virtual-machine) and the [docker](http://reprozip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/unpacking.html#the-docker-unpacker-building-a-docker-container) unpackers. However, any of the [available unpackers](http://reprozip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/unpacking.html#unpackers) can be used.
