This
is
a
text
file
with
text
in
it.
It
is
not
super
interesting
but
the
only
goal
is
to
count
lines,
so
content
is
not
important
here.
I
am
sitting
in
a
plane
watching
a
movie
and
adding
random
words
to
this
text
file
to
make
sure
it
is
several
pages,
and
I'm
not
really
focused,
but
it's
okay
because
no
one
is
every
going
to
read
it.
There
is
a
smell
of
candy
and
I
didn't
have
enough
to
eat,
and
the
movie
is
not
good,
but
at
least
I
didn't
have
to
watch
a
Marvel
so
far
so
I'm
not
complaining.
I
think
I
need
some
more
words
to
make
several
pages
although
I'm
planning
on
using
a
ViM
command
to
put
each
word
on
a
different
line.
I
think
backslash
r
is
a
newline
in
ViM,
I'll
know
soon
enough.
